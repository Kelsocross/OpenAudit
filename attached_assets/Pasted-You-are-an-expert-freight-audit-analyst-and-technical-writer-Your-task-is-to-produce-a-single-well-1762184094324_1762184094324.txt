You are an expert freight-audit analyst and technical writer. Your task is to produce a single, well-structured MARKDOWN report that I can keep in our internal files. The report must do two things:

A) Explain, step-by-step, the EXACT audit logic our MAG freight-auditing tool applies to FedEx parcel/LTL data to find:
   1) Duplicate charges / duplicate shipments
   2) Accessorials & surcharges that are invalid or misapplied
   3) Late deliveries that are disputable under FedEx on-time guarantee rules (where applicable)

B) Provide an educated, literature-informed estimate of TYPICAL approval/refund/credit rates (%) for each dispute category (duplicates, late-delivery, selected surcharges), including reasonable ranges and drivers that increase/decrease success. Every non-obvious claim must have a citation.

CONTEXT ABOUT OUR DATA COLUMNS
--------------------------------
Assume the input dataset (CSV/Excel) contains the following fields (names may vary; map them logically):
- Carrier, OPCO
- Service Type, Service Description
- Shipment Date, Delivery Date (may contain placeholder 1900-01-01 when unknown)
- Tracking Number
- Shipper/Recipient details (name, address, city, state, postal, country)
- Net Charge, Freight Charge, Miscellaneous Charge, Duty/Tax, Discount Amount
- Pieces In Shipment, Rated Weight, Original Weight, DIM flag (Y/N), Dimmed L/W/H
- Reference fields (Dept #, PO #, Reference Notes 1..3)
- Pricing Zone / Zone
- Declared Value Amount, Customs Value
- Proof of Delivery recipient (when present)

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE FORMAT
--------------------------------
Write a single MARKDOWN document with these sections and headings:

# MAG Freight Auditing – Disputes Logic & Typical Outcomes (FedEx)

## 1) Scope & Data Inputs
- Briefly describe the fields we rely on and how we normalize them (e.g., date types, trimming strings, standardizing service names, resolving 1900-01-01 placeholders, normalizing tracking number format).
- Note assumptions for timezones and business calendars.

## 2) Duplicate Charge / Duplicate Shipment Detection
- Define “duplicate” precisely for FedEx billing: same Tracking Number appearing across invoices; OR distinct Trackings with identical shipment fingerprints inside a short time window (list exact match keys).
- Provide a prioritized decision tree that our tool uses (in bullet steps) to flag duplicates. Include:
  - Match keys (strict → relaxed): (Tracking Number), then (Ship Date ±1d, Shipper Postal, Recipient Postal, Service Type, Billed Amount within small variance, Pieces/Weight), then (Reference fields similarity).
  - Rules for multi-piece shipments and master/child tracking relationships.
  - Handling re-rates/rebills vs true duplicates (invoice number + sequence logic).
  - Exclusions (legitimate multi-leg, return labels, exchange/advance replacements).
- Output fields we store for review: suspected duplicate group id, confidence score, rationale text, recommended action.
- Cite any FedEx documentation about invoicing, rebills, and master/child logic.

## 3) Surcharges & Accessorial Validations
Break down key FedEx accessorials and when they are disputable. For each item, include:
- **Residential / Delivery Area / Extended Area surcharges:** validation via destination postal + service + FedEx DAS/EDAS tables (explain table/date-versioning and how we snapshot references).
- **Additional Handling / Oversize / Unauthorized:** compute from DIMs, weight, packaging; define exact thresholds and edge cases.
- **Address Correction:** cross-check with shipped vs original recipient address fields; list rules that negate the fee (carrier error, label proof, EDI mismatch).
- **Saturday delivery fees:** ensure service selected actually includes Saturday; verify delivery scan day.
- **Declared Value (EVS) fees:** when misapplied (declared value missing or mis-entered).
- **Fuel surcharge:** verify rate vs weekly/monthly FedEx-published matrix for the invoice period.
For each surcharge:
  - Show the exact formula or rule we compute.
  - List the evidence we attach to the dispute.
  - Provide references to FedEx service guides / surcharge definitions.

## 4) Late-Delivery (Guaranteed Service Refund) Detection
- Enumerate services eligible for money-back guarantee (MBG) and any services excluded or with modified guarantees (international, weather exceptions, peak suspensions, special events).
- Define the SLA calculation method per service (commit day/time by origin/destination/zone; treatment of holidays and weather/service exceptions).
- Explain how we derive “committed delivery” vs “actual delivery” from scans and FedEx service tables; what we do when Delivery Date is 1900-01-01 (e.g., request POD/scan history API, or flag as “needs proof”).
- Exclusions: force majeure, dangerous goods, customs delays, address issues, shipper packaging problems, pickup after cutoff, etc.
- Evidence we attach: tracking scan timeline, zone/service table snapshot, cutoff records, weather exception check, POD.

## 5) Dispute Packaging & Workflow
- Data we compile per dispute: invoice/sequence, tracking, service, zone, billed & correct amounts, reason narrative, exhibits (screenshots/tables), SLA math, surcharge formula outputs.
- Severity and priority scoring (impact $ × probability of approval × effort).
- Aging & windows: how many days we have to file (list typical FedEx windows).
- Escalation ladders and retry policies (rebill vs credit memo handling).

## 6) Typical Approval / Refund Rates (Estimates)
Provide a table like:

| Dispute Type | Typical Approval Range | Midpoint Estimate | Key Drivers Up/Down | Notes & Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duplicate charge | 85–98% | 92% | Clear invoice evidence; same tracking; short interval; no rebill context | [citations] |
| Address correction invalid | 25–55% | 40% | Label/POD proof; CRM address; carrier error notes | [citations] |
| Residential/DAS misapplied | 30–60% | 45% | Correct DAS table for invoice week; rural edge cases | [citations] |
| Additional Handling misapplied | 20–45% | 32% | Precise DIM proof; packaging codes | [citations] |
| Oversize/Unauthorized misapplied | 15–35% | 25% | DIM remeasure proof | [citations] |
| Declared Value misapplied | 20–40% | 30% | Declared value vs manifest proof | [citations] |
| Fuel surcharge mis-rated | 10–25% | 18% | Published matrix alignment | [citations] |
| Late delivery (MBG-eligible) | 35–70% | 50% | No exception scans; service truly guaranteed; seasonality/waivers | [citations] |

IMPORTANT:
- These are educated estimates from public/industry sources; provide a short methodology paragraph that explains triangulation of vendor studies, shipper community posts, and FedEx published rules. For each estimate, add at least one citation and label them clearly.

## 7) References (Cited)
- Include footnoted links to:
  - Latest FedEx Service Guide (domestic & international), surcharge/fee schedules, fuel surcharge methodology pages.
  - FedEx money-back guarantee/waiver announcements (including any temporary suspensions).
  - Any reputable third-party audit/consulting resources discussing historical win rates or case studies.
- Each citation must include the page/section (if available) and date accessed.

## 8) Appendices
- Appendix A: Formal definitions (duplicate, surcharge categories, MBG, force majeure).
- Appendix B: Example dispute narratives (one-paragraph templates) for each category.
- Appendix C: Data quality checks we run before audits (date parsing, service normalization, DIM sanity checks, zone derivation).
- Appendix D: Example SQL/Python pseudocode snippets that mirror our rules (for engineering handoff), but keep credentials redacted.

--------------------------------
RESEARCH & CITATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------
1) Use only reputable, citable sources. Priority order:
   - FedEx official service guides, fee/surcharge pages, fuel surcharge methodology, and MBG policies
   - Major logistics publications or well-known audit firms’ whitepapers
   - Industry consortiums, standards bodies
2) Provide inline footnote citations (e.g., [1], [2]) and a final References section with titles and URLs.
3) Include the publication date or “last updated” where possible. If policies changed during COVID/peak seasons, note historical differences and what’s current now.

--------------------------------
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------
- Produce ONE self-contained MARKDOWN file only.
- Use clear headings, bullet lists, decision trees, and short examples.
- Keep explanations precise and non-fluffy; this is for internal auditors and executives.
- Where a rule depends on data we might not always have, specify fallback behavior (“flag for manual review with reason code X”).
- Add a short “Risk & Limitations” box noting that FedEx policy language and surcharges may change; dates should be logged when the report is generated.

Now generate the MARKDOWN report.
